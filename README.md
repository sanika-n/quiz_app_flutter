## Creating a Quiz App Using Flutter
I am currently working on this project to create an app using flutter, with node.js and postgreSQL as backend.
The Questions will be uploaded on the backend platform and will be dynamically fetched into flutter. 
Features I want to include:
* Displaying Leaderboard
* Enabling  Google Sign in
* Backend where questions can be uploaded in a user-friendly way
